This is a draft/dev repo submission, hence the nonsensical commits.  When the core functionality and core security implementations are complete, this project will be trashed and the code base will be recommitted as a fresh repo with an initial commit.  All other commits afterward will be performed via submitted branches (fix/etc, feature/etc, refactor/etc) with subsequent pull requests into master (or dev).
